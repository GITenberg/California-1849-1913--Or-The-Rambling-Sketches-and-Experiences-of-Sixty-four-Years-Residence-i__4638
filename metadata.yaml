description: Lell Hawley Woolley (b. 1825) left the Green Mountains of Vermont to
  cross the plains in a mule train to California in 1849. There he tried gold mining
  in Weaverville and Beal's Bar and hotelkeeping in Grass Valley before his marriage
  and the responsibilities of a home and family took him to San Francisco. There he
  went into business and was active in the Vigilance Committee of 1856. California,
  1849-1913 (1913) offers anecdotes of these adventures as well as brief notes on
  San Francisco personalities and business life in the 1850s and 1860s, with some
  references to later decades.
